                The

                motherfucking website

        <p>For real.</p>
        <h2>Styling?</h2>
        <p>
            You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You think your 4.99KB 
            <span class="brown-text">motherfuckingwebsite</span>
            (.com) is going to get you some award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
        </p>
        <p>Well, guess what, you're 
            <u class="doTham-text">WRONG</u>
            , motherfucker.
        </p>
        <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
        <p>
            Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past 
            <span >motherfuckingwebsites</span>
            :
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
            <li>
                The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the 
                <a href = "https://www.google.com/" class="ca1a70-test">Google home page</a>
            </li>
            <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)</li>
            <li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
            <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem 
                <span class="small_test">well, kind of</span>
            </li>
            <li>It's 
                <a href = "https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" class="ca1a70-test">accessible</a>
                , so everyone can enjoy it 
                <span class="small_test">but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span>
            </li>
            <li>Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an 
                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" class="ca1a70-test">ARPANET</a>
                website
            </li>
            <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use 
                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers" class="blue-test">IPoAC</a>
            </li>
            <li>Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called "Open Sans" which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</li>
            <li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
            <li>Doesn't include any tracking service</li>
            <li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.</li>
            <li>Use some fucking 
                <span class="bd-test">colors</span>
                .
            </li>
            <li>Links don't really need to keep that 
                <span class="shitty-blue-test">shitty blue</span> 
                the browser is giving them: nor that 
                <span class="violetish-test">violetish color</span> 
                when they are marked as visited. Just give them a 
                <a href = "https://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa" class="blue-test">nice color</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
        <p>This website is even better than the last     
            
            <a href = "http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/" class="ca1a70-test">guy</a>
            and the 
            <a href = "https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" class="ca1a70-test">guy before him</a>
            .
        </p>
        <h2>Put even less contrast</h2>

        <h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>
        <p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make a text that is only readable by ants.</p>
        <h2>Put some pictures</h2>
        
        <h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>
        <p>
            But this doesn't mean you should load your 
            <span class="brown-text">motherfuckingwebsite</span>
            with shitty animations. Keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users, less requests (with a small size) = faster load time! Oh and by the way, this doesn't mean that you should use webpack and put everything in a 10MB main.js file, there are people out there who are still using 56k modems and haven't tried

        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>This website was created by an annoyed developer that can

            <a href = "https://denv.it/" class="blue-test">here, on his ultra-minimalist website</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>The cat picture was taken from the cool 
            Pixabay 
            website: check it out, it's really cool and full of CC0 (aka Public Domain) content. The author was 1899441 on Pixabay (seriously? That username looks like my PIN code!), but that account seems to be gone now. The 
            old picture
            was by 
            aloiswohlfahrt
            , but I had to change it, cause it was too heavy and too cute. You can 
            open an issue on GitHub 
            if you think that this decision goes against the rules of a good looking 
            motherfuckingwebsite.
